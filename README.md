# Hey, I'm Szymon Kopycinski

I'm a **first-year Finance student** at the University of Nottingham, passionate about **quantitative finance** and building data-driven solutions. I've been coding since age 11, with proficiency in **Python**, intermediate skills in **R**, and experience in frontend web development. My goal is to blend finance and technology to tackle complex problems in markets.

- **Building Tools**: Leading **Drapt Analytics**, a Python-based portfolio analytics platform with real-time risk and performance modules, featuring Monte Carlo simulations and a professional web interface.
- **Competing and Analysing:** Senior Industrial Equity Analyst at the Nottingham Economics and Finance Society (NEFS) Investment Fund, where I earned **Outstanding Analyst** (top 4/120+), and Team Risk Lead in the WBSS Investment Challenge, utilising **Drapt Analytics** to secure us a spot in the finals, placing top 5 out of 80+ teams nationally.
