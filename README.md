# Hey, I'm Szymon Kopycinski

I'm a second year finance student at the University of Nottingham, passionate about **quantitative finance** and the intersection between programming, mathematics, and financial markets. I've been coding since age 11, with proficiency in **Python** and experience in full-stack web development. 

## 🌟 **What I'm Up To:**
- **Building Tools**: Leading **Drapt**, a full stack Python-based portfolio analytics platform developed in React for the frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL and Redis.
- **Learning Quant Finance**: Diving into *Quantitative Portfolio Management* by Michael Isichenko through hands-on Python projects, like backtesting momentum strategies and modeling mean reversion.
- **Competing and Leading:** Currently the Head of Systems at the Nottingham Economics and Finance Society Investment Fund (NEFSIF), managing technical infrastructure for 100+ student analysts and PMs. Previously a Senior Industrial Equity Analyst at NEFSIF, where I earned **Outstanding Analyst** (top 4/120+), and Team Risk Lead in the WBSS Investment Challenge, utilising **Drapt** to secure us a spot in the finals, placing top 5 out of 80+ teams nationally.

## 🧰 **Key Projects**:
- **Drapt**: Developing a portfolio analytics platform with a Python backend (FastAPI, NumPy, Pandas, statsmodels, Tiingo API), React.js frontend, PostgreSQL database and Redis cache. Self-deployed on Azure VM, configured Nginx reverse SSL proxy. Currently actively working on this. Closed source, please get in contact to view codebase.
- **[Road to Quant](https://github.com/szykopyc/road-to-quant)**: A self-directed journey into quant finance with Python notebooks on momentum trading, regime forecasting, and risk metrics. Currently inactively maintained, focusing solely on Drapt.

## 💻 **Tech Stack**:
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, FastAPI), JS
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Bloomberg, Excel
- **Frameworks**: React.js
