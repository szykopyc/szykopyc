I'm a **first-year Finance student** at the University of Nottingham, passionate about **quantitative finance** and building data-driven solutions. I've been coding since age 11, with proficiency in **Python**, intermediate skills in **R**, and experience in fullstack web development. My goal is to blend finance and technology to tackle complex problems in markets.
